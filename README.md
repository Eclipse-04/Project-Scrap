  Well, its a *work in progress*. It currently adds a few miscellaneous items, units, and its own reconstructers.
<br /> Click on the releases tab to manually download, or download from the in-game mod browser. 
<br />It could be fun, ill leave the judgment of whether or not it is fun to you. If you find any issues, please open a issue.
